## Employment Overview:

I created an interactive data visualization in Power BI to analyze key employment metrics in the private sector nationwide.
What is it?
This tool is part of the Ministry of Production's Business Observatory, providing detailed employment breakdowns by sector, region, and indicators like social protection (health insurance, pensions), along with metrics on decent and basic employment.
