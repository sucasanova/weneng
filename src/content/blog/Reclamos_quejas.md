## Complaints and Claims:

I initiated the proposal and development of the CEMI Dashboard, a tool that compiles essential information on consumer complaints during the pandemic. I also led the first version of this dashboard. 
What is it? 
This project received recognition at the Good Practices in Public Management Awards (2021) and won the Digital Democracy Awards (2022). The CEMI Dashboard offers rapid responses to consumer issues, facilitating investigations into companies and providers by Indecopi.
